Welcome to Hell tutorial hell, that is today is my first day of planning out the road ahead of me. The main issue with tutorial hell is that many people cannot build an app, website, or any other project they have in mind without a tutorial holding their hand every step of the way. So I have been on this road for a long time, and every time without a doubt, I hear the same advice build something, anything. So I decided I had to do something about this issue; I became tired of being stuck and wrote this blog to record the process of my successes and failures.

## What does the road ahead look like ?

The road ahead will start with the basics you have to walk before you can run. So I will be doing HTML & CSS for 30 days, focusing on coding designs and working in my developer environment of VS Code exclusively to simulate as close to a working environment as possible. In those 30 days, I will also work with git to push my code to GitHub. After these 30 days, the bulk of the learning will solidify JavaScript knowledge and progress to a framework, most likely React and React Native.

## Roadmap

- Html & CSS 30 days
  from day 1 to day 30 of blog posts.
- Git
  throughout the entire blog
- Javascript

- React
